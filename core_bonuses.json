No effect, attack or character can pass through the shield unless you allow it, and you can control the conditions inside this area however you please (temperature, moisture, light level, etc). When the scene ends or if you boot up your mech, the field dissipates. This field cannot be activated in any way during combat.</p>",
	"description": "<p>Designed to accompany Rubbleborn pioneers in more hazardous conditions, the Hardlight Chrysalis creates a protective “shell” that can turn any hostile environment into a suitable atmosphere with comfortable conditions. The power required to keep this field up, added to the necessity of exposing most of the frame's inner systems, creates a considerable risk when deploying the chrysalis. Because of this, it cannot be activated during high-intensity or combat situations.</p>",
