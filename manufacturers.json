When they were discovered, they were forced into attacking intruders by their creator, a person known as “The Maker”.</p><p>Now, liberated from its controlling influence, the Rubblefolk are free to pursue their own destiny. With the backing of Union, they’ve turned their industrial knowledge and intelligence to producing mining and surveillance equipment.</p><p>But the Lassen Cluster is a dangerous place, and the Rubblefolk are resourceful. With a few tweaks and modifications, their industrial equipment is able to be refit for combat, and their unique technologies provide an interesting edge compared to conventional designs.</p><p>Thus, Khepri Industrial Equipment was born. While expensive and requiring Union permission to purchase and print on a per-unit basis, KIE units are durable, rugged, and capable. They are highly team-dependent, but their specialties can often be shared with other allies.</p>","quote":"<p><em>Forge Thyself. Endure. Prosper.</em></p>"}]
