If a system causes a Save, it uses the donor’s Save Target instead of the user’s. If a system has a continuous effect, it is removed once adjacency is broken. Core Powers, Core Bonuses, and Talents are treated as normal.</p>"},{"id":"kie_hivemind","name":"HIVEMIND","description":"<p>HiveMind systems utilize a local sensor network to provide increased efficiency and coordination.
