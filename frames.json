		"active_effect": "<p>This System quickly builds up speed in place for the Pillbug to perform a mighty jump before crashing down. Unless Immobilised, you jump to a space within range 10, ignoring reactions, engagement and creating a tremor in a burst 2 zone when you land. </p><p>Objects and pieces of terrain in the affected area take 30 AP kinetic damage, and the area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the scene. Characters in the affected area must make an Agility save or fall prone, and a Hull save, taking 2d6 kinetic damage on a fail, or half as much damage on a success. </p><p>You then can jump up to another point within range 10, ignoring reactions and engagement, as the force of impact makes you bounce away. You can Roll Up as a part of this action.</p>",

It then loses all Overshield and unrolls.</p>",
